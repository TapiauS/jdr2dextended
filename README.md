# jdr2dextended



This is a personnal project trying to build a basic 2d MMORPG;
Rigth now the server part is not allways running so the game may not launch due to that.
To launch the game :
-download the jdr2d directory
-launch the clientlauncher.jar
(you can try launching the server part but you will miss the database access so it wont launch)

Already implemented feature:
-quests
-figth other player
-inventory and equipement management
-2 map (chest content procedurally generated)
-global chat

Future features:
-classes
-magics
-small animations


Far future:
-improved figth mechanics
-more chat options
